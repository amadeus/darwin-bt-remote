# Edge-out / hotkey-back checkpoint

## Run

Run `./build.sh`, then:

```sh
open .build/DerivedData/Build/Products/Debug/DeusKVM.app
```

The app lives in the menu bar after you close its window. Choose **Open controls…**
to reopen Setup, Layout, and Settings.

## Set up

1. Allow Bluetooth. In System Settings → Privacy & Security → Accessibility,
   add this worktree's built `DeusKVM.app` if necessary and enable it. An older
   DeusKVM permission entry may belong to a different build/signature.
2. Pair the Mac from Windows Bluetooth Settings as with the original app.
   Horizontal scrolling now adds a field to the HID mouse descriptor. An existing
   Windows pairing may need to be removed and paired once more to refresh its
   cached descriptor.
3. In **Setup**, keep only the PC active. **Layout** waits for exactly one active
   central subscribed to HID; selecting multiple active hosts leaves switching
   unarmed.
4. In **Layout**, choose the Mac display and an exposed edge, then enable edge
   switching. The default delay is 250 ms. An edge segment adjoining another Mac
   display is excluded so ordinary Mac display navigation still works.
5. Confirm the toggle shortcut. Default: **Fn + Escape**. If your keyboard handles
   Fn internally, use **Record shortcut** to choose a combination macOS receives.
   Keep the hotkey enabled for this checkpoint. No Windows companion is needed.

## Try

- Move to the configured edge and pause there: the Mac cursor parks and hides,
  and input controls the PC from its existing cursor position.
- Press and release the toggle shortcut: control returns to the Mac. Repeat
  from another foreground app and with the controls window closed.
- In a Windows app with content wider than its viewport, try horizontal trackpad
  scrolling in both directions, then vertical and diagonal scrolling. Horizontal
  scrolling uses the standard HID AC Pan field; confirm the content follows the
  same gesture direction as on the Mac. Live Windows validation is pending.
- Hold a letter (including autorepeat), Shift/Ctrl, or a mouse button while
  requesting a handoff. Releases should reach the current machine before it
  switches. A pending Mac edge request cancels if you move away from the edge.
- Hold the toggle shortcut: it must switch only once, after release.
- Check that moving remotely does not cause Dock, menu-bar, or application hover
  changes on the Mac, including on a full-screen Space.
- Try the hotkey while Windows is locked or showing UAC. Return does not need
  the PC to respond. PC edge-return is a later milestone.
- Turn off the PC's Bluetooth while remote: Mac input should return when the
  subscription disappears. Quitting the app also restores the Mac cursor.
- With Secure Input active on the Mac, switching should stay local or release
  with a warning in Layout.

Report any stuck key, cursor visibility/hover issue, unexpected switch, or change
in how remote movement/typing feels. Core HID changes are deferred until a
reproduced issue calls for them.

## Developer verification

```sh
DEVELOPER_DIR=/Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer \
  xcodebuild -project DeusKVM.xcodeproj -scheme DeusKVM \
  -configuration Debug -destination 'platform=macOS' \
  -derivedDataPath .build/DerivedData build test
```

The standalone tests cover exposed-edge geometry, negative coordinates, corner
exclusion, exact hotkey matching, repeat suppression, and release-before-switch.
They also cover horizontal and diagonal scroll capture, signed report encoding,
the mouse descriptor's field layout, and separate three-byte boot-mouse reports.
The report-mode mouse payload is now five bytes: buttons, X, Y, wheel, pan.

A bounded `--cursor-spike` diagnostic runs inside the same signed app, without
starting Bluetooth or forwarding input, and writes `/tmp/bt-cursor-spike.log`.
It checks the actual tap/cursor path and restores local control after three
seconds of capture (eight-second overall timeout). Quit the normal instance
before launching this diagnostic. It is only a test mode, not a helper process.
